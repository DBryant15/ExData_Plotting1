#this script is intended to recreate plot 1

#this is just the initial file for structuring. 

#Initial step will be to call in the power consumption data

#Next this will be subsetted. The subsetting will exclude 
#everything outside of the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02
#or first and second days of Feb. 2007

#this will be pushed to the other scripts. 

#this particular script will then create a bar graph with red bars, etc. 
#according to the assignment spec.
